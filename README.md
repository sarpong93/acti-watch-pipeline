In many research studies, participants are asked to wear smartwatches to monitor key health metrics such as sleep patterns, physical activity, and heart rate. After speaking with a researcher directly involved in such studies, I discovered that extracting specific pieces of information from the device exports was an extremely tedious processâ€”often involving hours of manually copying and pasting across multiple Excel files. To address this challenge, I developed the Acti-Watch Pipeline. This automated pipeline is specifically designed to work with data exported from ACTI watches, streamlining the extraction and transformation of relevant metrics. By using this script, researchers can effortlessly isolate and analyze the precise data points they need, saving significant time and reducing human error. Any study utilizing ACTI watch data is encouraged to adopt this tool to enhance their data preparation process and focus more on insights rather than data wrangling.
